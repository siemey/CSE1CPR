## CSE1CPR Lab Introduction

#### Background

Cyber security is a broad discipline covering policy, technology and business processes. Many of the fundamental cyber security concepts rely on a sound understanding of information technology. As a security practitioner, it is useful to be able to implement a security threat or control environment as a set of running machines. This allows you to fully understand the underpinning technical concepts, as well as to experiment with various scenarios.

In this subject we will perform many practical exercises within a personal experimentation or ‘test lab’ environment. We will build and configure a test lab using several technologies that are commonly utilised by security and information technology practitioners. Over the coming weeks we will use these core components to test and understand various security controls and operational topics. We will add components to the lab as we go, to allow us to explore all the cyber security topics covered in this subject.
