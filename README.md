### Background

This is a repository of practical lab worksheets, exercises and files to support the learning cirriculum of the first year cyber security subject **Cybersecurity in Practice**. 

The links below will take you to the pages describing the work required for each practical lab. Each lab contains a set of learning objectives and a series of guided exercises for you to follow. After each exercise there are questions to test your knowledge of the current topic. 

The lab environment consists mainly of **Linux virtual machines** that you will run yourself. Some additional information is supplied to guide you through the installation and setup of the **Oracle Virtual Box** virtual machine environment. This software is free and can be installed and run on your home PC, but please note that you will need to have enough computing power and free memory and hard disk space in order to successfully complete the labs. This will be explained in more detail as the labs progress.
